# GALTON BOARD SIMULATION

![distribution.png](imgs%2Fdistribution.png)

The objective of the program is to provide a solution to the **IPT 2024** question that states:

> Dropping a set of beads on a board with evenly distributed pegs results in a binomial distribution. Is it possible to generate other kinds of distributions by varying some parameters (Pegs size, pegs distribution, bead format, etc.)? Is it possible to achieve a distribution that does not obey the central limit theorem in an i.i.d. scenario? What happens to the distribution when one makes the board vibrate?

This is a simulation of the galton board that allows to obtain probability distributions from solving the physical system with certain configurable conditions.
It is possible to customize values such as:
- Number of particles.
- Angle and initial velocity of the particles.
- Characteristics of the pins.
- Vibrations of the pins.
- etc.
